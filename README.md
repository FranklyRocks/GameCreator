Modular multiplayer ready assets for Unity using Mirror network framework

Working on Unity 2020.1.4f1 and Mirror 25.1.2

All this components are syncronized with all players connected to the server:
 - Player
 	- Inventory
 - Pickups
 - Health (You can add health component to any gameobject and be destroyed by a weapon)
 - Weapons
 - Cars
  - Seats
 - Cameras
 - Movement
 
## Pickups
- Chest behaviour (collect multiple items at once)
- Add consumable effects on collect (health increase effect already added), easy extensible to add any custom effects.

Please keep in mind this project is not production ready, clients probably can cheat!
